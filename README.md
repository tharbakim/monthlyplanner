# Planner Pages

This is a collection of the planner pages I currenty use.

`/src/` contains the source files that generate them via SkwtchWow
`/pages/` contains the exported images that get printed.

Currently using a custom paper size that matches HappyPlanner's default size, 184 x 241mm
Bound together with HappyPlanner's mushroom punch and some generic discs.

## Typical Monthly Book

My typical workflow for a monthly book consists of:
* 1x `monthcover.png`
* 1x `MonthConclusion.png`
* (days of the month)x DayPage[#].png + DailySummary.png (double sided)
* (number of Saturdays) x WeeklySmmary.png + WeeklySummary2.png (double sided)
* 1x `month-brags.png`
* 1x `month-closing.png`

With any mix of the other pages mixed in where necessary, as planning/meetings/projects require.
